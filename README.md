# AI_Text_Detection
Abstractâ€”As the prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to rise, so too do concerns over their potential misuse, such as in AI-plagiarism scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for discriminating between human-written and LLM-generated text. Our approach leverages an ensemble of machine learning and deep learning algorithms, distinguishing itself from existing methods. We utilize a unique dataset comprising text generated by LLM and human authors across various topics. After extensive experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in accurately discerning between human and LLM-generated text.
