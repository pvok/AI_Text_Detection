"My internship experience further enhanced my skills in data analysis, model interpretation, and research. I have a proven track record of adapting to new environments and technologies quickly, as evidenced by my publications and certifications in data science and machine learning.",1
"I am so happy, that I can't express. I wish I had someone with me to share this happiness or this moment with me.",0
"Furthermore, my interest in public health and my dedication to community service, as demonstrated through my volunteer experience with AIESEC's Sawasdee Project, align well with the mission of the Health Promotion & Education team. I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences to contribute to creating a campus community that supports and empowers individuals to make healthy lifestyle choices.",1
"I like to read books, my favourite book is Devil's Prayer. I also like to read anime manga, but most importantly I prefer coding over everything.",0
"The detection of machine-generated text (MGT) has become increasingly crucial in various domains, ranging from online content moderation to preserving academic integrity and ensuring the reliability of medical literature. Here, we review five recent papers that delve into this complex issue, exploring methodologies, challenges, and advancements in distinguishing between human and AI-generated texts.The first paper [1] investigates the impact of data length, specifically token size, on the ability of models to differentiate between ML-generated and human texts. Using RoBERTa-base for English and XLM-RoBERTa-base for Russian, the authors demonstrate that data length significantly influences the classifier's capacity to discern between the two types of text, with specific token lengths providing sufficient contextual information for effective differentiation.",1
"My skills in utilizing LLM models for data analysis, coupled with experience in web scraping and leveraging technology to optimize processes, make me well-suited for research topics within this area, such as large language model-based automated annotation of communication data. Through this internship, I hope to deepen my expertise in utilizing AI and technology to assess complex skills, particularly in areas such as critical thinking, creativity, and digital literacy. Additionally, I aim to further refine my skills in data analysis, model interpretation, and applying AI techniques to real-world problems. Ultimately, I aspire to contribute to the development of innovative assessment methodologies that can accurately measure and foster the development of complex skills critical for educational success and future workplace readiness.",1
"Due to some reason my PC crashed so had to start all over again. Currently running with about 15k rows(The dataset I was working on). Simple RNN. with following columns
comma_count
period_count
word_count
top 2000 count vectorizer.
After execution completion will RUN LSTM on full 65k and RNN on 65 K and the Data on the drive with 7k rows. 
Full 65K rows should take for RNN should take 30-40 Mins per epoch so will run them over night",0
